## 🧠 How It Works

This app initializes a whiteboard using the ZegoCloud SDK inside a React component. With a pre-generated token, it loads a local whiteboard where you can:

- Draw freehand 🖊️  
- Insert shapes ▭ ⭕  
- Add text ✍️  
- Use eraser 🧽  
- Highlight with laser ✨  

All of this is done **without any real-time collaboration** — the board is meant for single-user, standalone use.
